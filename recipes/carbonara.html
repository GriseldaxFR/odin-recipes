    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>1 ¼ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
  <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  <li>1 red onion, cut in half and thinly sliced</li>
  <li>1 red, green, or yellow bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
  <li>2 zucchinis, halved lengthwise and cut into ¾-inch pieces</li>
  <li>½ cup golden raisins</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>Grated zest of one orange</li>
  <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can low-sodium chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
</ul>

<h2> Directions </h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside. </p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet. </p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more. </p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>

<p>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</p>
